		<h2>What I do to reduce stress.</h2>
		<p>Here are some ways that I reduce stress and calm myself:<br><br>1.Exersise. This is problay one of the best ways (for me) to reduce the amount of stress that I have. For me, it helps get my energy out and it keeps me occupied. If I have stress, it will turn into aggresion sometimes which I can take out running lifting weights, etc...<br><br> 2. Video games. Like I mentioned in the media assigment, video games help reduce my amount of stress and help me escape the outside world and be in a virtuial one with no rules.<br>,<br> 3. Last but not least,talking and spending time with family. I really enjoy spending time and talking with my family. Personally, I enjoy talking to people about different things and how they are doing. Sometimes I also like to outlet to other people by talking to them. Espically in times like this, it is important to make sure to talk and bond with your family to keep your reltionship strong with them. </p>
